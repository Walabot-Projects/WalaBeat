# WalaBeat
Air drums using Walabot

# How To Use
Just attach the Walabot under a table facing up (Using velco for example), Set the Arena and thresholds to fit you table and start playing your drums :)

# Walabot API
This demo uses the `Walabot_GetRawImageSlice()` method, dividing the raster image into Left and Right, summing up the energy on each side and thus setting apart the right drum from the left.
